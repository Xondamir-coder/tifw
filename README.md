# 🌐 TIFW

**A modern multi-page landing experience for banking, insurance & fintech — built with Nuxt 4, GSAP, and a sprinkle of motion magic.**

TIFW isn't just another landing page.  
It’s a full-blown digital experience crafted for a company working in **banking**, **insurance**, and **fintech**, with plans to grow into a fully dynamic platform with API-powered content.

Think:  
_Glassy UI, smooth animations, multilingual pages, responsive images, and a design system cleaner than a brand-new credit card._

## 🎯 Naming & Architecture Philosophy

The project follows a “no extra wrappers” philosophy:

- strictly **BEM** for naming components
- **gaps instead of margins**
- **adaptive rem scaling** based on the 1440px design
- **global UI components** kept clean and reusable
- **no unnecessary containers** (sanity maintained)
